# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
There are two players (X and O) on the game board. Each of them has to take turn smartly clicking on the each nine square. First player is going be "X"
and the second will be "O".
To win the game, the marks (XXX or OOO) on the squares have to be a straight line either vertically or horizontally or diagonally. 
# <h2>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h2>
When we get a winner, the straight line will bounce to congratulate the winner.
